        Federative Republic of Brazil (Portuguese: audio speaker 
        iconRepública Federativa do Brasil),[11] is the largest 
        country in both South America and Latin America. At 8.5 
        million square kilometers (3,300,000 sq mi)[12] and with 
        over 211 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest
         country by area and the sixth most populous. Its capital is 
         Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. The 
         federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and 
         the Federal District. It is the largest country to have 
         Portuguese (namely Brazilian Portuguese) as an official 
         language and the only one in the Americas;[13][14] it is 
         also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse 
         nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from 
         around the world;[15] as well as the most populous Roman 
         Catholic-majority country.
